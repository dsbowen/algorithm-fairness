<p>Hello! We are researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and are interested how you look forward to predict the future. We will show profiles of criminal offenders and ask you to predict how likely they are to commit future crimes. Please read the information below and if you wish to participate, indicate your consent.</p>

<p><b>Because this is an experimental platform, you may encounter errors during this survey. If you experience an error, please email Dillon Bowen at dsbowen@wharton.upenn.edu. Copy this email address now in case you encounter an error during the survey.</b></p>

<p><b>Purpose.</b> The purpose of this study is to explore how people think about the future.</p> 

<p><b>Procedure.</b> You will take a survey which lasts approximately 10-20 minutes.</p> 

<p><b>Benefits & Compensation.</b> {}</p> 

<p><b>Risks.</b> There are no known risks or discomforts associated with participating in this study.</p> 

<p>Participation in this research is completely voluntary. You can decline to participate or withdraw at any point in this study without penalty though you will not be paid.</p> 

<p><b>Confidentiality.</b> Every effort will be made to protect your confidentiality. Your personal identifying information will not be connected to the answers that you put into this survey, so we will have no way of identifying you. We will retain anonymized data for up to 5 years after the results of the study are published, to comply with American Psychological Association data-retention rules.</p> 

<p><b>Questions</b> Please contact the experimenters if you have concerns or questions: dsbowen@wharton.upenn.edu. You may also contact the office of the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, at 215.573.2540 or via email at irb@pobox.upenn.edu.</p>

<p>Please read these instructions carefully. We will test your understanding on the next pages.</p>

<p>In this study, we will describe profiles of criminal offenders. Based on an offender's profile, you will predict how likely he or she is to commit another crime within 2 years.</p>

<p>For example, you might predict that an offender has a 50 in 100 chance of committing another crime within 2 years.</p>
